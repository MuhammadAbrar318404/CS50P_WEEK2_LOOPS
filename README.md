# CS50P_WEEK2_LOOPS
This is week2 of the CS50P which was about the Loops, this repo contains the project files that i have designed to practice the learnt things  

## CamelCase to snake_case (camel.py)

The `camel.py` script converts a CamelCase string to snake_case. It prompts the user to input a CamelCase string and outputs the corresponding snake_case version. The conversion follows the convention of separating words with underscores and converting all letters to lowercase.

## Coke Machine Simulator (coke.py)

The `coke.py` script simulates a coke machine that accepts coins in denominations of 5, 10, and 25 cents. It prompts the user to insert coins until at least 50 cents have been entered. Then, it calculates and outputs the amount of change owed to the user.

## Twitter Text Processor (twttr.py)

The `twttr.py` script removes vowels (A, E, I, O, U) from a given text string, whether the vowels are uppercase or lowercase. It prompts the user for input and outputs the text with all vowels removed.

## Vanity Plate Validator (vanity.py)

The `vanity.py` script validates license plates for vanity plates in Massachusetts. It checks if the provided plate meets the requirements:
- Starts with at least two letters
- Contains a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters
- Numbers must come at the end, not in the middle, and the first number cannot be '0'
- No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed

## Nutrition Facts Lookup (nutrition.py)

The `nutrition.py` script allows users to input a fruit name and outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit. It utilizes a dictionary containing fruit names as keys and their respective calorie counts per portion as values. The input is case-insensitive, and the script ignores any input that isn't a fruit.
